## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

In the project, a multi-section landing page is developed with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## 💡 How the landing page works <a name = "how"></a>
 
 - The multi-section landing page can identify number of sections and automatically create a navigation menu on the top pages;
 - The landing page can direct users to a section when select the section on the naviagtion menu;
 - The landing page can identify which section is within viewpoint and then highlight it in the naviation menu. 

## 🚀 Future updates <a name = "future_updates"></a>

- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load);
- setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling;
- Add a scroll to the top button on the page that’s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page;
- Make sections collapsible.
